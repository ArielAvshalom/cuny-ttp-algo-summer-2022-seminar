They are diagramming/visual aid files from [excalidraw] (https://excalidraw.com/). It's free, no need to create an account.

They are diagrams for some of the problems that we covered in this course. For most, there is a [repl] (https://replit.com/~), which is public and contains solution code.
For most, there are drawings of problems we covered that you can manipulate, add to, etc.

Download them, go to the site and click the load button (it's a folder icon). That's it.

Good luck out there!
