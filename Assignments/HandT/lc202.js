// Problem Statement #

// Any number will be called a happy number if, after repeatedly replacing it with a number equal to the sum of the square of all of its digits, leads us to number ‘1’. All other (not-happy) numbers will never reach ‘1’. Instead, they will be stuck in a cycle of numbers which does not include ‘1’.

const find_happy_number = function(num) {
  // TODO: Write your code here
  return false;
};


console.log(`${find_happy_number(23)}`)
console.log(`${find_happy_number(12)}`)
