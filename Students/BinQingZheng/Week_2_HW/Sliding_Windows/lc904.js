// Problem Statement #

// Given an array of characters where each character represents a fruit tree, you are given two baskets, and your goal is to put maximum number of fruits in each basket. 
// The only restriction is that each basket can have only one type of fruit.

// You can start with any tree, but you canâ€™t skip a tree once you have started. You will pick one fruit from each tree until you cannot, i.e., you will stop when you have to pick from a third fruit type.

// Write a function to return the maximum number of fruits in both baskets.

    let windowStart = 0,
      maxNumber = 0;

      } else {
