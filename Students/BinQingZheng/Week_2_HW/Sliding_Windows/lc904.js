// Problem Statement #

// Given an array of characters where each character represents a fruit tree, you are given two baskets, and your goal is to put maximum number of fruits in each basket. 
// The only restriction is that each basket can have only one type of fruit.

// You can start with any tree, but you canâ€™t skip a tree once you have started. You will pick one fruit from each tree until you cannot, i.e., you will stop when you have to pick from a third fruit type.

// Write a function to return the maximum number of fruits in both baskets.

function fruits_into_baskets(fruits) {
    // TODO: Write code here
  }
  
  console.log(
    `Maximum number of fruits: ${fruits_into_baskets(['A', 'B', 'C', 'A', 'C'])}`
  );
  console.log(
    `Maximum number of fruits: ${fruits_into_baskets([
      'A',
      'B',
      'C',
      'B',
      'B',
      'C',
    ])}`
  );
