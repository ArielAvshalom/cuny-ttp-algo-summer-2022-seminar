// Problem Statement #

// Given an array of characters where each character represents a fruit tree, you are given two baskets, and your goal is to put maximum number of fruits in each basket. 
// The only restriction is that each basket can have only one type of fruit.

// You can start with any tree, but you canâ€™t skip a tree once you have started. You will pick one fruit from each tree until you cannot, i.e., you will stop when you have to pick from a third fruit type.

// Write a function to return the maximum number of fruits in both baskets.

function fruits_into_baskets(fruits) {
    let windowStart = 0,
    maxNumber = 0;
    const fruitFrequency = {};
    console.log("object created");
    
    for (let windowEnd = 0; windowEnd < fruits.length; windowEnd ++) {
      const rightFruit = fruits[windowEnd];
      if (!(rightFruit in fruitFrequency)) {
        fruitFrequency[rightFruit] = 0;
      }
      fruitFrequency[rightFruit] += 1;

      while (Object.keys(fruitFrequency).length > 2) {
        const leftFruit =fruits[windowStart];
        fruitFrequency[leftFruit] -= 1;
        if (fruitFrequency[leftFruit] === 0) {
            delete fruitFrequency [leftFruit];
        }
        windowStart += 1;
      }
       maxNumber = Math.max(maxNumber, windowEnd - windowStart + 1);
    }
    return maxNumber;

  `Maximum number of fruits: ${fruits_into_baskets(['A', 'B', 'C', 'A', 'C'])}`
