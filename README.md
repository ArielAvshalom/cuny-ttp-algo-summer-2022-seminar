## Course Overview

<details><summary>Click to Read About the Course!</summary>
  
We will categorize coding interview problems into a set of 10 patterns. Each pattern will be a complete tool - consisting of data structures, algorithms, and analysis techniques. These tools will enable you to solve a specific category of problems. The goal is to develop an understanding of the underlying pattern, so that, we can apply that pattern to solve other problems.

Each problem not only maps to the same pattern but also presents different constraints. Overall, the course has around 125+ problems of varying difficulties. The problems solved under these patterns use a varied set of algorithmic techniques.

We will start with a brief introduction of each pattern before jumping into the problems. Under each pattern, the first problem will explain the underlying pattern in detail to build the concepts that can be applied to later problems. The later problems will focus on the different constraints each problem presents and how our algorithm needs to change to handle them.

</details>
  
## Assignments

<details><summary>Intro</summary>
  
- For any assignment where we ask you to solve a problem(s) or conduct mock technical interviews in class, please work in a code editor of choice and submit your work to github periodically throughout the day with descriptive comments

- The `assignments` folder is where you find the assigned classwork & homework for each day. Assignments are broken down into 1 of 16 patterns, furthermore, you will find subfolders with the week and day designation (for example w1d1 stands for "week 1 day 1")

</details>

### Submitting Work

#### Methodology

<details><summary>Methods</summary>

1. Each of you should **fork and clone this repository**.
2. Make sure to pull from the central repository every day as files will updated periodically.
3. Enter the students folder in your fork and create a folder with your name in camelCase (eg _arielAvshalom_).
4. From this point on, follow this strategy for committing your work:

   A. Create a branch for a week (create one on our first day for the first 5 days) and call is week\_# (eg (week_1\*)

   B. For every day create a new issue labeled day\_# (eg _day_1_)

   C. For each issue, make sure to commit often and periodically with helpful comments (eg _started problem #..._ or _completed problem #..._ or _attempted but could not solve problem #..._ etc)

   D. Once you finish your work for the day, close the issue

   E. Once the week is complete, merge the branch to your repository and then make a pull request to the central repository.

</details>
  
#### Important PSAs:

<details><summary>PSAs</summary>

- Always work in your own folder, not a classmates.
- Commit early and commit often
- Delete your branches after merging (make sure that you properly merged before doing this!)
- Avoid merge conflicts, think before you commit!

##### On assignments:

- You will complete all algos listed in the syllabus on a weekly basis.
- We will review your comments/high level overview & code to identify strengths and weaknesses within your understanding of each pattern.
- You will NOT complete your homework all in one shot & will NOT save. Attempting to master Data-structures and Algorithms requires constant exposure to these questions and solutions. You will create a commit through GitHub on your branch each night solving at minimum one problem which you were not able to solve during class time.

</details>

#### What if the problem is too hard? Can't solve it in time?

<details><summary>Details</summary>

1.  Spend 15-30 minutes trying to solve the problem if you are not able to, write and submit a program containing the following:

        As comments:

        - a description of the approach(es) you thought of
        - a description of where you got stuck on these approaches.

    For example: - Was there a flaw in the approach you found and you had to think
    of a new one? What was the flaw? How did you try to get around
    it? - Were you just unable to implement the approach? Which part(s)
    were you unable to implement, and why?

2.  If you get stuck reverse engineer the existing solution and take a few moments to digest it. (\*a few moments may take longer for leetcode hard)

    As code:

    - Type out the the program in your language by referencing the solution provided (2-3 times, No copy/pasting)
    - Reference leetcode discussion and reverse engineer a solution which fits most with your style.
      example:
      - If you seldom use higher order functions, then do not attempt to reverse engineer solutions which focus on these
      - If you prefer a certain implementation of a data-structure over another, please cater to your strengths

3.  Move on to the next problem.

    As a mindset:

    - Many will struggle with the common coding patterns for the first few times they encounter them, it is extremely important to learn how to move on with the intentions of revisiting said topic at a later date.
      example:
      - While we were young we would be assigned tasks like brushing our teeth, bathing, etc... Our parents would surely not allow us to "attempt" to brush our teeth for 90 minutes in pursuit of perfection at this stage in our lives, instead, they would likely step in and "take over" to ensure that we got it done. The emphasis was never on getting it perfect in one singular session, but, achieving muscle memory and improvement of motor skills through repition.

## Interviews

<details><summary>Details</summary>

- Each student will be given one of two problems with solutions the day before class
- You will be assigned a partner on the day of class
- You will interview the partner and learn to think like an interviewer, then the interviewer will fill out a Google Form with their thoughts on the process
- After the first interview, switch roles and repeat
- Submit your solutions under the day of the interview in your assignment folder as interview_week_day
