# Problem Statement #

# Given an array containing 0s, 1s and 2s, sort the array in-place. You should treat numbers of the array as objects, hence, we canâ€™t count 0s, 1s, and 2s to recreate the array.

# The flag of the Netherlands consists of three colors: red, white and blue; and since our input array also consists of three different numbers that is why it is called Dutch National Flag problem.

def dutch_flag_sort(arr):
  # TODO: Write your code here
  return

def main():
  arr = [1, 0, 2, 1, 0]
  dutch_flag_sort(arr)
  print(arr)

  arr = [2, 2, 0, 1, 2, 0]
  dutch_flag_sort(arr)
  print(arr)


main()








# Solution
# -----
# def dutch_flag_sort(arr):
#   # all elements < low are 0, and all elements > high are 2
#   # all elements from >= low < i are 1
#   low, high = 0, len(arr) - 1
#   i = 0
#   while(i <= high):
#     if arr[i] == 0:
#       arr[i], arr[low] = arr[low], arr[i]
#       # increment 'i' and 'low'
#       i += 1
#       low += 1
#     elif arr[i] == 1:
#       i += 1
#     else:  # the case for arr[i] == 2
#       arr[i], arr[high] = arr[high], arr[i]
#       # decrement 'high' only, after the swap the number at index 'i' could be 0, 1 or 2
#       high -= 1

# -----

# Time complexity #
# The time complexity of the above algorithm will be O(N) as we are iterating the input array only once.

# Space complexity #
# The algorithm runs in constant space O(1).
