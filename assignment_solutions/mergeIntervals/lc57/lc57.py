# Problem Statement #

# Given a list of non-overlapping intervals sorted by their start time, insert a given interval at the correct position and merge all necessary intervals to produce a list that has only mutually exclusive intervals.

def insert(intervals, new_interval):
  merged = []
  # TODO: Write your code here
  return merged


def main():
  print("Intervals after inserting the new interval: " + str(insert([[1, 3], [5, 7], [8, 12]], [4, 6])))
  print("Intervals after inserting the new interval: " + str(insert([[1, 3], [5, 7], [8, 12]], [4, 10])))
  print("Intervals after inserting the new interval: " + str(insert([[2, 3], [5, 7]], [1, 4])))


main()




# Solution
# -----
# def insert(intervals, new_interval):
#   merged = []
#   i, start, end = 0, 0, 1

#   # skip (and add to output) all intervals that come before the 'new_interval'
#   while i < len(intervals) and intervals[i][end] < new_interval[start]:
#     merged.append(intervals[i])
#     i += 1

#   # merge all intervals that overlap with 'new_interval'
#   while i < len(intervals) and intervals[i][start] <= new_interval[end]:
#     new_interval[start] = min(intervals[i][start], new_interval[start])
#     new_interval[end] = max(intervals[i][end], new_interval[end])
#     i += 1

#   # insert the new_interval
#   merged.append(new_interval)

#   # add all the remaining intervals to the output
#   while i < len(intervals):
#     merged.append(intervals[i])
#     i += 1
#   return merged

#   -----

# Time complexity #
# As we are iterating through all the intervals only once, the time complexity of the above algorithm is O(N), where ‘N’ is the total number of intervals.

# Space complexity #
# The space complexity of the above algorithm will be O(N) as we need to return a list containing all the merged intervals.
